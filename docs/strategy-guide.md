# Strategy Guide

This guide provides advanced strategies for success in Lawmaker. Whether you're aiming for electoral dominance, legislative influence, or coalition leadership, these tactics will help you achieve your goals.

## Core Principles

### 1. Consistency is King

**The most important strategy:** Vote consistently with your ideology.

Why it works:

- ✓ **Clear party brand** - Voters know what you stand for
- ✓ **Predictable behavior** - Coalition partners trust you
- ✓ **Electoral appeal** - Voters reward consistency
- ✓ **Long-term credibility** - No flip-flopping accusations

!!! success "The Golden Rule"
A mediocre ideology voted consistently will outperform a perfect ideology voted inconsistently. Voters value reliability over perfection.

### 2. Know Your Voters

Study the [elector system](gameplay/elections.md#understanding-voters):

- Each elector has preferences on 8+ issues
- They vote for parties matching their values
- Recent votes matter more than old votes
- Consistency matters more than individual votes

**Action:** Commission [polls](gameplay/elections.md#polling) regularly to track your standing.

### 3. Think Long-Term

Electoral success takes multiple cycles:

- **First election** - Establish presence, win some seats
- **Second election** - Build on record, grow seats
- **Third election** - Achieve breakthrough or coalition leadership
- **Fourth+ elections** - Sustained success or natural decline

Don't expect instant dominance. Build steadily.

## Ideological Positioning

### Finding Your Niche

**Analyze the political landscape:**

1. **Review existing parties** - What ideologies are covered?
2. **Identify gaps** - Where is there an underserved voter segment?
3. **Check voter distribution** - Where are most electors positioned?
4. **Choose unique position** - Don't clone existing parties

- Pragmatic over ideological

**Electoral base:** Moderate voters, swing voters, pragmatists

**Strategy:** Build broad coalitions, compromise legislation, stability messaging

!!! warning "Centrist Challenge"
Centrist positioning is difficult - you can appear indecisive. If you go centrist, be **consistently moderate**, not randomly inconsistent.

## Legislative Strategy

### Proposal Timing

#### Early in Election Cycle

**Best for:**

- ✓ Controversial proposals
- ✓ Testing voter response
- ✓ Establishing record

**Why:** Voters forget over time. Controversial votes early in cycle have less electoral impact.

#### Mid-Cycle

**Best for:**

- ✓ Routine legislation
- ✓ Coalition-building proposals
- ✓ Standard policy changes

**Why:** Normal legislative activity. Neither too risky nor too visible.

#### Late in Cycle (Pre-Election)

**Best for:**

- ✓ Popular proposals
- ✓ Campaign-defining legislation
- ✓ Coalition statements

**Why:** High visibility. Recent votes matter most to voters. This is your campaign platform.

!!! danger "Late-Cycle Risk"
Avoid proposing unpopular or divisive legislation late in election cycle. It will cost you votes!

### Multi-Article Strategy

**Single-article proposals:**

- ✓ Clear message
- ✓ Easier to pass
- ✓ Specific focus
- ✗ Uses full 30 PP for one change

**Multi-article proposals (2-5 articles):**

- ✓ Efficient use of PP
- ✓ Coherent policy package
- ✗ Harder to pass
- ✗ One bad article can sink entire proposal

!!! tip "Package Deals"
Use multi-article proposals for ideologically coherent packages: "Green Energy Transition Act" (renewable energy + emission standards + conservation) makes sense together.

### Building Support Before Proposing

**Don't waste 30 PP on failed proposals:**

1. **Draft proposal** - Plan what you'll propose
2. **Message potential supporters** - Use [communication](gameplay/communication.md)
3. **Offer deals** - Vote trading, coalition agreements
4. **Count votes** - Do you have majority support?
5. **Propose** - Only when you have the votes

!!! success "Pre-Negotiation"
The best proposers spend more time negotiating support than writing the proposal. Build your majority **before** spending PP.

## Coalition Strategy

### Finding Coalition Partners

**Look for parties with:**

- Similar ideological positions (±0.3 on key issues)
- Compatible legislative goals
- Reliable voting records
- Active, communicative leaders

### Coalition Negotiation Tactics

#### 1. The Even Split

**Distribute benefits proportionally:**

- Cabinet positions by seat share
- Legislative agenda time-sharing
- Mutual support commitments

**Example:**

- Party A (250 seats, 38%): PM + 3 ministers
- Party B (180 seats, 28%): Deputy PM + 2 ministers
- Party C (90 seats, 14%): 1 minister

#### 2. The Senior-Junior Partnership

**Larger party leads, smaller party supports:**

- Senior partner: More cabinet positions, sets agenda
- Junior partner: Guaranteed support for key priorities
- Clear hierarchy prevents disputes

#### 3. The Issue Alliance

**Partner on specific issues, not overall:**

- "We'll support your environmental laws if you support our worker protections"
- Flexible, issue-by-issue cooperation
- Good for parties with mixed compatibility

### Coalition Management

**Maintain your coalition through:**

1. **Regular communication** - Don't ghost your partners
2. **Honor agreements** - Vote as promised
3. **Share credit** - Public recognition of partners' contributions
4. **Flexibility** - Compromise on minor issues
5. **Transparency** - No secret deals that undermine coalition

!!! warning "Coalition Collapse"
Most coalitions fail due to: - Broken vote commitments - Poor communication - Uneven benefit distribution - Ideological drift by one partner

## Electoral Strategy

### Vote Timing and Elections

**Votes 0-30 days before election:** CRITICAL - Very high impact

**Votes 30-90 days before election:** Important - Moderate impact

**Votes 90+ days before election:** Foundational - Lower impact but builds record

!!! tip "Campaign Mode"
Enter "campaign mode" 30 days before elections: - Only vote on safe, popular proposals - Commission polls to track position - Communicate electoral platform - Avoid risks

### Reading the Electorate

**Commission polls to track:**

- Your vote share trajectory (rising/falling?)
- Competitor positions
- Turnout projections
- Seat predictions

**Adjust strategy based on polls:**

- **Leading:** Maintain course, avoid risks
- **Competitive:** Differentiate from rivals, take clear positions
- **Trailing:** Bold moves needed, propose popular legislation

### Post-Election Strategy

**After winning seats:**

1. **Form government** - Lead [cabinet formation](gameplay/cabinet.md) if largest party
2. **Recruit characters** - Build [activist roster](gameplay/characters.md) for cabinet
3. **Propose agenda** - Use electoral mandate for proposals
4. **Strengthen coalitions** - Reward supporters

**After losing seats:**

1. **Analyze defeat** - What went wrong?
2. **Adjust ideology** - Small tweaks if needed
3. **Build opposition** - Coordinate against government
4. **Prepare for next cycle** - Start building new record

## Resource Management

### Political Power Budgeting

**Weekly sustainable budget:** ~168 PP (24/day × 7 days)

**Recommended allocation:**

- **60-90 PP** - Proposals (2-3 per week)
- **30-50 PP** - Character recruitment (3-5 per week)
- **20-40 PP** - Polls (2-4 per week)
- **Reserve** - 30-60 PP saved for opportunities

### PP Efficiency Tips

1. **Coordinate with coalition** - Take turns proposing to share costs
2. **Use free actions extensively** - Voting, messaging, commenting
3. **Don't cap out** - Spending wasted generation is inefficient
4. **Poll before proposing** - 10 PP poll can prevent wasting 30 PP
5. **Recruit strategically** - 3 great characters > 10 mediocre ones

## Character Strategy

### Building Your Roster

**Early game (Cycles 1-2):**

- Recruit 2-3 activists with high traits
- Focus on persuasion traits for proposing
- Save PP for proposals

**Mid game (Cycles 3-5):**

- Expand to 5-7 activists
- Add profile-focused characters for cabinet
- Develop star politicians

**Late game (Cycles 6+):**

- Maintain 7-10 top activists
- Replace low-performers
- Build recognizable party leadership

### Character Roles

**Assign specific roles:**

- **Chief Legislator** - High persuasion, authors all proposals
- **Cabinet Members** - High profile, fill government positions
- **Rising Stars** - Growing activists, future leaders
- **Specialists** - Issue-focused characters

## Advanced Tactics
