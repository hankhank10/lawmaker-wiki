# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Lawmaker, answered.

## Getting Started

### What is Lawmaker?

Lawmaker is a multiplayer political simulation game where you manage a political party in a fictional democracy. You propose laws, vote on legislation, compete in elections, and form governments - all while competing against other human players.

See: [Game Concept](game-concept.md)

---

### Is Lawmaker free to play?

Check the official website at [lawmakergame.com](https://lawmakergame.com) for current pricing and access information.

---

### How much time does Lawmaker require?

**Minimum:** 15-30 minutes per day to vote on proposals and manage your party

**Recommended:** 1-2 hours per day for active coalition building, proposing laws, and strategic planning

**Game time:** 1 real hour = 1 game day, so the game progresses even when you're offline. You don't need to be constantly active.

---

### Can I play on mobile?

Check the official website for information about platform support and mobile access.

---

## Parties & Politics

### Can I change my party's ideology after creation?

Your party's **stated ideology** (pillars) are set at creation, but you can:

- **Vote differently** than your stated positions
- **Adjust positions** (if game allows editing)
- **Build a new record** through voting

However, voters judge you by your **voting record**, not your stated ideology.

---

### Can I create multiple parties?

**In different countries:** Yes, encouraged for experienced players

**In the same country:** Generally not allowed or discouraged - check your country's rules

Each party you create has independent Political Power, voting record, and seat count.

---

### How do I delete my party?

Parties typically become inactive if you stop playing. Check game settings or contact administrators for party deletion options.

---

### What happens if I don't vote on a proposal?

**Not voting = Abstaining** - Your vote is recorded as "Abstain" which doesn't count toward Yes or No.

**Electoral impact:** Excessive abstentions can make your party look weak or indecisive to voters.

---

## Legislation

### How long do I have to vote on proposals?

**60 game days** (2.5 real days) from when the proposal opens.

---

### Can I change my vote after casting it?

**Yes!** You can change your vote anytime during the 60-day voting period. Only your final vote counts.

---

### What happens if a proposal ties?

**Ties go to No** - A proposal needs >50% Yes votes to pass. Exactly 50% is not enough.

---

### Can I withdraw a proposal after submitting it?

Generally **no** - Proposals cannot be withdrawn once submitted. The 30 PP cost is spent regardless of outcome.

**Lesson:** Build support before proposing!

---

### How many proposals can I have active at once?

Usually **no hard limit**, but consider:

- Each costs 30 PP
- Managing multiple proposals requires attention
- Too many proposals can dilute your message

**Recommended:** 1-2 active proposals at a time

---

## Elections

### When are elections held?

**Regular schedule:** Typically every **4 game years** (~96 game days = ~4 real days)

**Early elections:** Can be triggered by parties spending 30 PP and winning vote

Check your country's election schedule for specific dates.

---

### Do I need to register for elections?

**No** - All parties with defined ideologies automatically participate in elections. No registration required.

---

### How are seats allocated?

**Proportional representation:**

```
Your Seats = (Your Votes / Total Votes) × Total Seats
```

**Example:** 25% of votes → ~25% of seats

---

### Why did I lose seats despite voting correctly?

Possible reasons:

- **Inconsistent voting** - Voted against your ideology
- **Unpopular positions** - Voters disagreed with your votes
- **Competition** - Another party appealed to your voters better
- **Timing** - Controversial votes right before election
- **Low turnout** - Your voters stayed home

**Solution:** Commission polls to diagnose issues, adjust strategy

---

### Can I win a majority alone?

**Rarely** - Proportional systems make majorities uncommon. Most elections result in no party exceeding 50% of seats.

**Normal outcome:** Coalitions are necessary to form governments

---

## Government & Cabinet

### Do cabinet positions give me special powers?

**Mostly symbolic** - Cabinet positions provide:

- ✓ Prestige and credibility
- ✓ Character development (authority, followers)
- ✓ Political statement
- ✗ No direct mechanical powers

**Real power** comes from seats and voting weight, not cabinet positions.

---

### How long does a government last?

**Until one of these happens:**

- Next election occurs
- Coalition collapses
- New cabinet formation is approved
- Government resigns

**Typical:** One election cycle (4 game years)

---

### Can I be in government without being the largest party?

**Yes!** Coalition governments distribute power among multiple parties. You can join as a junior partner even with fewer seats than the lead party.

---

## Resources

### How do I get more Political Power?

**Automatic generation:** 1 PP per game day (1 real hour)

**Maximum:** 120 PP capacity

**Only way to speed up:** You can't - generation is fixed rate. Manage your PP budget carefully!

---

### What's the best use of Political Power?

**Priority order:**

1. **Proposing important laws** (30 PP) - Core party activity
2. **Recruiting key activists** (10 PP) - Long-term investment
3. **Commissioning polls** (10 PP) - Strategic intelligence
4. **Calling early elections** (30 PP) - Only when advantageous

**Avoid:** Wasting PP on failed proposals or unnecessary character expulsions

---

### I'm at 120 PP and it's not increasing. What's wrong?

**Nothing is wrong!** 120 PP is the maximum capacity. Once you reach the cap, PP stops generating.

**Solution:** Spend PP on proposals, recruitment, or polls to drop below cap and resume generation.

---

## Characters

### How many characters should I recruit?

**Recommended:**

- **Early game:** 2-3 activists
- **Mid game:** 5-7 activists
- **Late game:** 7-10 activists

**Quality over quantity** - 3 high-trait activists are better than 10 mediocre ones.

---

### Can characters leave my party?

**Expulsion only** - Characters don't leave voluntarily. You must spend 25 PP to expel them.

**Once expelled:** They're permanently gone from your party.

---

### Do characters have real effects on gameplay?

**Yes:**

- **Persuasion** affects proposal success likelihood
- **Profile** determines follower growth rate
- **Cabinet positions** build authority and followers
- **Proposals** authored by high-persuasion activists are more compelling

---

## Technical & Gameplay

### What happens if I stop playing for a while?

- Your party remains in the game
- You continue gaining PP (up to 120 cap)
- Elections occur without your votes (abstentions)
- Other parties may perceive you as inactive
- Extended inactivity may result in party removal

**Recommended:** Log in at least every few days to stay active

---

### Can I see other parties' voting records?

**Yes!** All votes are public. You can view:

- How any party voted on any proposal
- Complete legislative history
- Electoral results
- Current seat counts

**Transparency:** Everything is visible to all players

---

### How do I contact other parties?

Use the **messaging system** ([guide here](gameplay/communication.md)):

- Send private messages to any party
- Free (0 PP cost)
- Unlimited messaging

---

### Is there voice chat or real-time communication?

The game provides **text-based messaging**. Any additional communication (Discord, etc.) is organized by players independently.

---

## Strategy

### What's the best ideology to win?

**No single best ideology** - Success depends on:

- Your country's voter distribution
- Existing party competition
- Consistency of your voting
- Coalition-building skills

**Key:** Find an underserved ideological niche and vote consistently.

---

### Should I join the largest coalition or stay independent?

**Trade-offs:**

=== "Join Coalition"
    ✓ Cabinet positions
    ✓ Legislative influence
    ✓ Shared resources
    ✗ Compromise on positions
    ✗ Share credit

=== "Stay Independent"
    ✓ Full autonomy
    ✓ Clear opposition brand
    ✓ No compromises
    ✗ Harder to pass laws
    ✗ Excluded from government

**Recommendation:** Join coalitions when ideologically compatible, oppose when not.

---

### How important are polls?

**Very important** - Polls show:

- Your current electoral position
- Whether your strategy is working
- Which voters you're winning/losing
- When to adjust course

**Recommended:** Commission polls every 30-60 game days (1-2 real days)

---

### When should I propose legislation?

**Best timing:**

- **After building coalition support** - Don't waste 30 PP
- **Early-to-mid election cycle** - Allows time for voter memory
- **When you have PP to spare** - Don't deplete reserves
- **After winning election** - Claim electoral mandate

---

## Community & Rules

### Are there rules about party behavior?

**Common rules:**

- No harassment or abuse of other players
- No cheating or exploitation
- No creating multiple parties in same country (check specific rules)
