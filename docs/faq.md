# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### How many parties can I have?

Each player can control **one party** at a time.

### How much Political Power do I start with?

New parties start with **100 PP**. You regenerate 1 PP per game day (1 real-world hour), up to a maximum of 120 PP.

### What's the game pace?

**1 real-world hour = 1 game day.** You don't need to be online constantly. Checking in once or twice a day to vote and make decisions is sufficient.

### Do I have to agree to the rules?

Yes. Before you can fully participate, you'll be asked to read and agree to the game rules. These cover basic expectations like staying in character, not using real-world names, and being respectful.

## Gameplay

### How do elections work?

Elections happen on a schedule set per legislature. Each elector (AI-driven voter) reviews your party's voting record and decides who to support. Seats are allocated proportionally to vote share. See [Elections & Voters](gameplay/elections.md).

### Why can't I vote on a proposal?

You need **seats in the relevant legislature** to vote. Parties with 0 seats have no voting weight. Win seats in elections first.

### What's a front person?

The activist from your party who publicly sponsors a bill. Their persuasion, authority, and follower count affect how the proposal is perceived. Bills without a front person get a 5% penalty. See [Legislation & Voting](gameplay/legislation.md).

### How do constitutional changes differ from normal proposals?

Constitutional changes cost **60 PP** (vs 30 PP), require a **supermajority** (typically 66.6% vs simple majority), may need approval from **multiple legislatures**, and have a **cooldown period** after passing. See [Constitution](gameplay/constitution.md).

### What happens when I'm inactive?

After 8 days of inactivity, you'll receive a warning email. After 10 days, your party may be auto-disbanded (only if the country is 70%+ full). Log in regularly to stay active.

### What are party modifiers?

Temporary effects that influence your electoral performance. Currently there are two: **Energised Base** (+20% turnout boost from Supporter Rallies) and **Campaign Finance Scandal** (-10% vote preference from random events). See [Campaign Events](gameplay/campaigning.md).

## Characters & Activists

### How does recruitment work?

Pay 10 PP and you'll be shown **3 randomly generated candidates**. Review their traits and pick one — they join your party immediately. See [Characters & Activists](gameplay/characters.md).

### How many traits do characters have?

Every character is generated with **3-5 traits** covering personality, skills, and background. Some have gameplay effects (like Charismatic boosting persuasion), while others are purely for flavour.

### What are free agents?

Characters who have been expelled from a party. Any party can recruit a free agent for the normal 10 PP cost.

## Communication

### What group chats are available?

Beyond direct messages, you have access to: **Country chat** (all parties), **Government chat** (ruling parties), **Opposition chat** (non-government parties), **Bloc chats** (international bloc members), and **Custom group chats** (player-created).

### Can I get email notifications?

Yes. Visit the **Email Preferences** page to configure alerts for 11 different event types including new proposals, elections, messages, and more.

## Political Power

### What's the PP cap?

**120 PP.** Any generation beyond 120 is wasted, so spend PP before hitting the cap.

### How do I earn PP faster?

Hold government positions! Each gives a multiplicative bonus: Head of State (+20%), each cabinet position (+10%), holding legislature seats (+10%), holding a legislature majority (+10%).

### What are all the PP costs?
