4. **Accessibility** - Complex doesn't mean complicated
5. **Balance** - No dominant strategy or pay-to-win

### What We Won't Add

Some things don't fit Lawmaker's vision:

- ✗ **Direct player conflict** - No attacking other parties' resources
- ✗ **Pay-to-win mechanics** - No purchasing PP or votes
