# Development Roadmap

**Key**
:white_check_mark: Completed
:map: In progress
:x: Not planned
:work_in_progress: In progress

**Character system**
:white_check_mark: Basic character system with names, traits and ability to recruit/expel activists
:white_check_mark: Region-relevant names
:white_check_mark: Characters are chosen as the "front person" for a bill
:white_check_mark: Appoint characters to positions in cabinet (interacts with **Form Government** system)
:white_check_mark: Characters have an impact on elections

**Form Government system**
:white_check_mark: Each country has positions which are not elected directly but are appointed with the consensus of a directly elected legislature (eg Prime Minister, Finance Minister are appointed by parliament in Westminster-style democracies, appointed by the President in US-style democracies)
:white_check_mark: Parties can propose to "form a government" and propose candidates to fill these positions - the candidates can be from different parties to reflect coalitions. If the relevant legislature passes the "form government" motion then the government is formed and those characters take the roles.
:white_check_mark: Governments can "collapse" through losing a vote of no confidence
:white_check_mark: Parties display "in government" or "opposition" flags

**Presidential rework**
:map: Parties can propose candidates to be elected to a legislature
:map: Parties can propose a particular candidate for president
:map: Define impeachment motions with custom rules for each country (eg x% of senate, x% of house)

**Polling rework**
:white_check_mark: Hide existing polling data (was always intended to give insights into the backend but not really for gameplay)
:white_check_mark: Parties now have to spend PP to commission voting-intention polls
:map: Parties can spend PP to commission polling on individual measures before they are proposed
:map: Clearer way to show citizen views and why they vote why they do as a group

**Messaging rework**
:map: Messages more intiutively built into the UI

**Social media**
:white_check_mark: Journalists report major events on social media
:map: Parties can post to social media
