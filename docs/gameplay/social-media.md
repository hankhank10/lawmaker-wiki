# Social Media Feed

Every country in Lawmaker has a **social media feed** — a public timeline of posts from characters, NPC journalists, and game bots. The feed chronicles major political events and provides flavour and commentary on what is happening in your country.

## Viewing the Feed

Navigate to your country's social media page to see the latest posts. Posts appear in reverse chronological order, with the most recent at the top.

## Who Posts

### Characters

Your party's [activists](characters.md) generate social media posts in response to game events. Characters with more followers generate more engagement (likes, shares, comments).

### NPC Journalists

AI-controlled **journalist** characters post independent political commentary:

- They are not affiliated with any party
- Their posts reflect and react to current events
- They provide flavour and help tell the story of your country's politics

### Game Bots

Automated accounts post announcements for major events:

| Bot | Role |
|-----|------|
| **LawBot** | Legal system notifications — proposals opened, laws passed or failed, constitutional changes |
| **NewsBot** | News and announcements |
| **GameMaster** | Game administration and rulings |
| **EconBot** | Economic updates and market information |

## What Gets Posted

The feed automatically generates posts for major game events, including:

- **Party events** — new party created, party disbanded
- **Legislation** — proposal opened for voting, proposal passed or failed
- **Constitutional changes** — change proposed, passed, or failed
- **Elections** — election results announced
- **Government** — government formation attempts, cabinet appointments
- **International blocs** — bloc founded, party joined or left
- **Campaign events** — successful [Supporter Rallies](campaigning.md) that trigger the Energised Base modifier
- **Party modifiers** — events like campaign finance scandals

## Character Growth from Posts

Social media activity contributes to [character development](characters.md):

- **Sponsoring a bill** gives a character a follower boost
- **A sponsored bill passing** gives a larger follower boost
- **Posting comments** on proposals gives a small follower boost
- Characters in cabinet positions or with high-profile traits grow followers faster

Higher follower counts increase a character's influence and contribute to their effectiveness as a [bill sponsor](legislation.md).

## Next Steps
