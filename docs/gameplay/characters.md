## Managing Your Roster

### Party Activists List

View all your party's activists:

- Current cabinet positions
- Follower counts
- Authority scores
- Traits
- Join dates

### Expelling Activists

You can **expel** activists from your party:

- **Cost:** 25 Political Power
- **Effect:** Character leaves your party immediately
- **Consequence:** Lose any cabinet positions they held
- **Warning:** Can't rejoin your party

!!! warning "Expensive and Permanent"
    Expelling activists is costly and irreversible. Only do this if absolutely necessary (e.g., need to make room for better candidates or after scandal).

### Roster Size

There's typically **no hard limit** on activist count, but:

- Each recruitment costs 10 PP
- More activists = harder to manage
- Quality > Quantity
- Most successful parties have 3-7 core activists

## Character Strategy

### Specialist Approach

Build a **specialized roster**:

- 1-2 **persuasive speakers** for proposing laws
- 1-2 **media-savvy faces** for cabinet positions
- 1-2 **all-rounders** for flexibility

### Star System

Focus on building **star politicians**:

- Recruit high-trait activists early
- Give them cabinet positions when possible
- Use them to author important proposals
- Build their follower counts over time
- Create recognizable party leaders

### Depth vs. Stars

Two approaches:

=== "Star System"
    **Few high-profile activists**

    ✓ Clear party leadership
    ✓ Recognizable faces
    ✓ Efficient PP use
    ✗ Less flexibility
    ✗ Vulnerable if star leaves

=== "Deep Bench"
    **Many activists**

    ✓ Flexibility in appointments
    ✓ Multiple cabinet members
    ✓ Resilient to losses
    ✗ Expensive (10 PP each)
    ✗ Harder to build individual profiles

## Character Development

### Growth Mechanics

Activists improve through:

1. **Time in party** - Experience matters
2. **Cabinet positions** - Government service boosts profile
3. **Successful proposals** - Authoring passed laws builds authority
4. **Public activity** - Social media engagement grows followers
5. **Electoral success** - Winning elections helps everyone

### Career Progression

Typical activist career:

1. **Recruit** (Day 1) - Join party with base stats
2. **Backbencher** (Years 1-2) - Build experience
3. **Rising Star** (Years 2-4) - Increase authority and followers
4. **Cabinet Member** (Years 3-6) - Hold government positions
5. **Party Leader** (Years 5+) - Top persuasion and profile

!!! tip "Patience Pays Off"
    Don't expect new recruits to be superstars immediately. The most valuable activists are those who've been with your party for years.
