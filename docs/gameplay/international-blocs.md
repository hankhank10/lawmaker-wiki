# International Blocs

**International Blocs** are cross-country alliances of parties with shared political goals. They add a structured way to collaborate beyond one country's borders.

## Accessing Blocs

Open **International -> International Blocs** from the main navigation to:

- Browse all existing blocs
- Create a new bloc
- Open bloc details, membership, and applications

Bloc memberships are also visible on:

- Your **Dashboard** (active party bloc card)
- Each **Party Detail** page

## Founding a Bloc

To found a bloc, your active party must have:

- **50 Political Power (PP)** available
- At least one core pillar (you choose one as the bloc's defining pillar)
- A unique bloc name
- A description
- Clear **membership criteria** (required)
- An SVG logo

When created:

- 50 PP is deducted from the founding party
- The founding party is set as both **Founder Member** and **Leader**
- A dedicated bloc group chat is created automatically
- Bloc prestige is calculated immediately on creation
- Your party is shown with a **Founder** badge on the bloc list

## Joining a Bloc

If your party is not a member, you can apply from the bloc detail page:

- Submit a rationale (max 1000 characters)
- Application costs **20 PP**
- Cost is **not refunded** if the application is denied
- You can only have one pending application to the same bloc at a time
- The bloc's published membership criteria are shown in the application panel
- Bloc leaders are notified by email when your application arrives (if they have that notification enabled)

## Leadership and Membership Rules

Bloc leaders can:

- Approve or deny pending applications
- Designate existing members as additional leaders
- Edit bloc logo settings
- Resign as leader (only when another active leader remains)

Membership constraints:

- Founder members cannot leave their own bloc
- Founder members cannot resign as leader
- The final active leader cannot resign
- The final remaining leader cannot leave
- Leaving a bloc removes your party from that bloc's chat
- If only one active (non-disbanded) member remains, that member is automatically kept as leader

## Disbanding a Bloc

A bloc can be disbanded by:

- Any founder member
- The final active leader (for example, if founders are inactive/disbanded)

Other members and non-final leaders cannot disband the bloc.

Disbanding permanently removes the bloc, including memberships and applications.

## International Prestige

Blocs have an **International Prestige** score shown on list/detail pages. Blocs are sorted by this score first.

Prestige factors currently include:

- +1 per member party in the bloc
- +1 per member party that matches the bloc's defining pillar on that issue
- -2 per member party that takes the opposite position on the defining issue
- Legislative clout:
  - +1 for each active multi-seat legislature where a member party has over 25% of seats
  - Additional +1 for each active multi-seat legislature where a member party has over 50% of seats (total +2 there)
- +1 per member party currently holding a head-of-government role
- +1 per member party currently holding any cabinet office
- +1 per member party with passed legislation in the last 90 in-game days

Notes:

- Single-seat legislatures do not contribute legislative clout points
- Disbanded parties are excluded from prestige calculations
- Admin/staff users can trigger recalculation from the bloc list page

## Bloc Group Chats

Each bloc has an automatic **Bloc Group Chat**:

- Membership stays synced with current bloc members
- Parties from different countries can chat together
- These chats appear in the messaging drawer under **Bloc Group Chats**
- Unread bloc chat messages count toward the navbar unread badge

## Social and Community Visibility

Major bloc events are announced in game systems:

- Founding a bloc can trigger a Lawbot social post
- Approving a new member can trigger a Lawbot social post
- Both events can also post to Discord webhooks

## Strategy Tips

- Use blocs to formalize long-term cooperation, not just one-off vote trades
- Appoint multiple leaders before leadership transitions
- Keep bloc descriptions and logos clear so other parties can quickly assess fit
