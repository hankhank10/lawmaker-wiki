# Communication

**Communication** between parties is essential for coalition building, negotiation, and strategic coordination in Lawmaker. This guide covers the messaging and discussion systems.

## Why Communication Matters

In a game built on proportional representation and coalition politics:

- **No party usually has a majority** - Must work with others
- **Proposals need support** - Build consensus before proposing
- **Coalitions require coordination** - Negotiate cabinet deals
- **Strategy benefits from allies** - Coordinate voting and timing

!!! success "Communication is Free!"
Unlike most actions in Lawmaker, communication costs **0 Political Power**. Use it extensively!

!!! tip "Community Communication"
Beyond in-game messaging, many players coordinate and discuss strategy on our **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/gKAvGTFKzB)**. Join to connect with your country's community, share strategies, and build relationships outside the game!

## Messaging System

### Party-to-Party Messages

The main communication tool is **direct messaging** between parties:

- Send private messages to other parties
- Receive messages from other parties
- Like email but within the game
- Persistent conversation threads

### Bloc Group Chats

If your party belongs to an [international bloc](international-blocs.md), you also get access to that bloc's shared group chat:

- Created automatically when a bloc is founded
- Membership updates automatically as parties join or leave
- Supports cross-country coordination in one thread
- Appears in the messaging drawer under **Bloc Group Chats**

!!! info "Unread Badge Behavior"
    Unread bloc chat messages are included in your navbar unread message count.

### Sending Messages

To send a message:

1. Navigate to the messaging interface
2. Select recipient party
3. Write subject line
4. Compose message body
5. Send

**Cost:** Free (0 PP)

### Message Components

#### Subject Line

Brief summary of message purpose:

- ✓ **Good:** "Coalition proposal - Environmental legislation"
- ✓ **Good:** "Vote coordination on Proposal #47"
- ✗ **Bad:** "Hey"
- ✗ **Bad:** "Important"

#### Message Body

Detailed message content:

- State your purpose clearly
- Be specific about proposals
- Include concrete offers/asks
- Professional but friendly tone

!!! tip "Writing Effective Messages"
Be clear, specific, and action-oriented. "Will you vote Yes on my healthcare proposal in exchange for my Yes vote on your education proposal?" is better than "Maybe we can work together sometime."

### Message Threads

Messages create **conversation threads**:

- All messages with a party in one place
- Can reference previous messages
- Build ongoing relationship
- Track agreements over time

## Types of Communication

### 1. Coalition Negotiations

**Purpose:** Form governing coalitions

**Content:**

- Cabinet position offers
- Legislative agenda agreements
- Vote coordination commitments
- Duration and terms

!!! example "Coalition Message"
Subject: "Coalition Proposal - Progressive Alliance"

    Hi Social Democratic Party,

    Our recent election results show:
    - Green Party: 230 seats (35%)
    - Social Democrats: 180 seats (28%)
    - Together: 410/650 seats (63%)

    I propose a coalition with this cabinet distribution:
    - Green Party: Prime Minister, Environment Minister, Transport Minister
    - Social Democrats: Finance Minister, Health Minister, Education Minister

    We'd commit to:
    - Universal healthcare expansion (your priority)
    - Green energy transition (our priority)
    - Progressive taxation (shared goal)

    Interested in discussing?

### 2. Vote Trading

**Purpose:** Exchange support on proposals

**Content:**

- "I'll vote Yes on X if you vote Yes on Y"
- Specific proposal identification
- Clear quid pro quo
- Timeline for fulfillment

!!! example "Vote Trading Message"
Subject: "Vote trade proposal - Labor laws"

    Hi Workers' Party,

    I need support for my minimum wage proposal (Proposal #142). In exchange, I'll vote Yes on your union rights proposal (Proposal #138).

    Both align with our pro-worker positions. Deal?

### 3. Legislative Coordination

**Purpose:** Align on policy agenda

**Content:**

- Proposal timing
- Multi-party legislative packages
- Shared priorities
- Avoid duplication

!!! example "Coordination Message"
Subject: "Environmental legislation timing"

    Hi Climate Action Party,

    I'm planning to propose renewable energy subsidies next week. I see you're working on carbon tax legislation. Should we coordinate timing so we don't compete for votes on similar issues?

    Maybe: My proposal this week, yours in two weeks, we both vote Yes on each?

### 4. Information Sharing

**Purpose:** Share polls, analysis, strategy

**Content:**

- [Poll results](elections.md#polling) (if public)
- Electoral analysis
- Voter sentiment observations
- Strategic insights

!!! example "Information Message"
Subject: "Poll results - Election forecast"

    Hi Centrist Alliance,

    I commissioned a public poll (see attached). Results show:
    - Left-wing parties: 52% combined
    - Right-wing parties: 48% combined

    This suggests left coalition could win majority. Interested in coordinating on post-election government formation?

### 5. Diplomatic Relations

**Purpose:** Build relationships, goodwill

**Content:**

- Congratulations on electoral success
- Praise for good proposals
- General relationship building
- Long-term partnership cultivation

!!! example "Diplomatic Message"
Subject: "Congratulations on election result"

    Hi Liberal Party,

    Congrats on your strong showing in the election - gaining 40 seats is impressive! Your campaign on civil liberties clearly resonated with voters.

    Looking forward to working with you in the new legislature.

## Proposal Comments

### Public Discussion

Each [proposal](legislation.md) has a **comment thread**:

- Visible to all parties
- Public record
- Threaded discussion
- Attached to specific proposals

### Using Comments

Comments are useful for:

1. **Making your case** - Argue for your proposal publicly
2. **Responding to criticism** - Defend against attacks
3. **Persuading undecided parties** - Appeal to on-the-fence voters
4. **Explaining your vote** - Justify Yes/No/Abstain to public
5. **Negotiating amendments** - "I'd vote Yes if you changed Article 3"

### Comment Strategy

=== "As Proposer"
**Defend your proposal**

    - Respond to criticisms quickly
    - Provide additional justification
    - Show willingness to listen
    - Thank supporters publicly

=== "As Voter"
**Explain your position**

    - State why you're voting Yes/No/Abstain
    - Reference your party's ideology
    - Show consistency with past votes
    - Build public record

=== "As Opponent"
**Argue against proposal**

    - Point out flaws or problems
    - Suggest alternatives
    - Rally opposition
    - But remain respectful

### Public vs. Private Communication

| Proposal Comments (Public) | Messages (Private)             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ✓ Visible to all parties   | ✓ Confidential negotiation     |
| ✓ Creates public record    | ✓ Can discuss sensitive topics |
| ✓ Influences other parties | ✓ Make concrete deals          |
| ✓ Shows transparency       | ✓ No public commitment         |
| ✗ Can't negotiate secretly | ✗ Only between two parties     |
| ✗ Commits you publicly     | ✗ Not visible to others        |

!!! tip "Use Both"
Use **messages** for negotiations and deals. Use **comments** for public advocacy and explanation.

## Communication Strategy

### Building Trust

Effective communication builds trust:

- **Honor commitments** - If you say you'll vote Yes, do it
- **Be transparent** - Explain your positions clearly
- **Respond promptly** - Don't leave messages unanswered
- **Stay professional** - Even when disagreeing
- **Build relationships** - Long-term partnerships matter

### Coalition Building

To build effective coalitions:

1. **Identify natural allies** - Parties with similar ideology
2. **Reach out early** - Before you need their votes
3. **Make specific offers** - Concrete proposals, not vague promises
4. **Follow through** - Build reputation for reliability
5. **Maintain relationship** - Ongoing communication, not just when you need something

### Negotiation Tactics

#### 1. Make First Offer

Benefits of going first:

- Set the terms of negotiation
- Show initiative and leadership
- Establish baseline expectations

#### 2. Be Specific

Concrete offers work better than vague ones:

- ✓ "I'll vote Yes on proposals #142 and #145"
- ✗ "I'll probably support your proposals"

#### 3. Find Win-Wins

Look for mutually beneficial deals:

- Both parties get something they want
- Create long-term partnerships
- Build stable coalitions

#### 4. Know Your BATNA

**BATNA** = Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement

- What happens if this deal falls through?
- Do you have other potential partners?
- How badly do you need this deal?

### Handling Conflict

When parties disagree:

- **Stay professional** - No personal attacks
- **Focus on issues** - Debate policies, not people
- **Seek compromise** - Find middle ground
- **Agree to disagree** - Not every conflict needs resolution
- **Move on** - Don't let one disagreement destroy relationship
