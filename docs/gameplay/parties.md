# Party Management

Your **political party** is your primary tool for participating in Lawmaker. This guide covers how to create, customize, and manage your party effectively.

## Creating a Party

To create a new party:

1. Select a [country](../countries.md) to participate in
2. Click "Create New Party"
3. Fill in the party details
4. Define your ideological positions
5. Launch your party!

### Party Information

#### Basic Details

### Defining Your Ideology

The most important part of creating your party is setting **ideological positions**. You'll define where your party stands on 8+ major issues:

#### The 8 Core Issues

| Issue | Left Position | Right Position | What It Means |
|-------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Gender Equality** | Traditional gender roles | Full gender equality | Family structure, workplace equality, gender policy |
| **Role of Religion** | Secular governance | Religious influence | Church-state separation, religious freedom vs. tradition |
| **Environment** | Economic growth first | Environmental protection | Climate policy, regulation, green energy vs. industry |
| **Individual Liberty** | Strong leadership | Maximum freedom | Government authority vs. personal autonomy |
| **Military** | Diplomatic solutions | Strong military | Defense spending, intervention, peace vs. strength |
| **Immigration** | Border security | Open borders | Immigration quotas, citizenship, cultural integration |
| **Economy** | Wealth redistribution | Free market | Taxation, welfare, regulation vs. capitalism |
| **Workers' Rights** | Business-friendly | Worker protections | Labor laws, unions, minimum wage |

#### Additional Issues

- **Multiculturalism**
- **Support for Young People**
- **Law and Order**
- And more...

#### How to Set Positions

Each issue has a **slider from -1 to +1**:

- **-1.0** = Strongly left/progressive position
- **0.0** = Centrist/neutral position
- **+1.0** = Strongly right/conservative position

!!! example "Example Party Ideology"
    **"Green Progressive Alliance"**

    - Gender Equality: **+0.9** (strong equality)
    - Role of Religion: **-0.8** (secular state)
    - Environment: **+1.0** (maximum protection)
    - Individual Liberty: **+0.6** (personal freedom)
    - Military: **-0.7** (diplomatic approach)
    - Immigration: **+0.5** (welcoming)
    - Economy: **+0.4** (moderate redistribution)
    - Workers' Rights: **+0.8** (strong protections)

### Party Pillars

Your ideological positions become your party's **pillars** - the core values you campaign on. These are visible to:

- Other parties (to understand your positions)
- The game's voter simulation (affects which voters support you)
- Players researching the political landscape

## Managing Your Party

### Party Dashboard

Your dashboard displays:

- **Current seats** in each legislature
- **Political Power** (PP) available
- **Active proposals** you need to vote on
- **Upcoming deadlines** (elections, votes closing)
- **Recent activity** in your country

### Party Actions

With your party, you can:

1. **[Vote on proposals](legislation.md)** - Shape legislation (free)
2. **[Propose new laws](legislation.md)** - Submit legislation (30 PP)
3. **[Recruit characters](characters.md)** - Add activists to your team (10 PP)
4. **[Commission polls](elections.md#polling)** - Survey electoral prospects (10 PP)
5. **[Send messages](communication.md)** - Communicate with other parties (free)
6. **[Attempt cabinet formation](cabinet.md)** - Form governments (free, requires seats)
7. **[Call early elections](elections.md#early-elections)** - Trigger special elections (30 PP)

## Party Growth

### Gaining Seats

Your party gains seats through [elections](elections.md). Seat count is determined by:

- **Vote share** - More votes = more seats (proportional system)
- **Voter preferences** - Electors vote based on their values
- **Your voting record** - Voters judge you by your legislative history
- **Consistency** - Voting according to your ideology builds trust

### Building Influence

Successful parties:

- Vote consistently with their stated ideology
- Build coalitions with like-minded parties
- Recruit charismatic [characters](characters.md) with high follower counts
- Time their proposals strategically
- Manage [Political Power](resources.md) efficiently

### Party Reputation

Your party builds a reputation through:

- **Legislative record** - How you voted on every proposal
- **Laws enacted** - Which laws you successfully passed
- **Government participation** - Cabinet positions held
- **Longevity** - Surviving multiple election cycles

## Party Strategy

### Ideological vs. Electoral Strategy

There are two main approaches:

=== "Ideological Purity"
    **Vote your values consistently**

    ✓ Clear party identity
    ✓ Attracts ideologically aligned voters
    ✓ Builds trust and credibility
    ✗ May limit electoral appeal
    ✗ Could alienate centrist voters

=== "Electoral Pragmatism"
    **Vote to maximize appeal**

    ✓ Broader electoral base
    ✓ Can win centrist voters
    ✓ Flexible coalition building
    ✗ Inconsistent record
    ✗ May confuse voters
    ✗ Vulnerable to attacks on flip-flopping

!!! tip "Finding Balance"
    Most successful parties find a middle ground: stay true to core values while being flexible on less important issues.

### Coalition Building

Since proportional representation rarely gives any party a majority:

- **Identify natural allies** - Parties with similar ideologies
- **Communicate actively** - Use the [messaging system](communication.md)
- **Coordinate proposals** - Support each other's legislation
- **Share government** - Distribute cabinet positions fairly
- **Build trust** - Honor agreements and vote as promised

### Timing Your Proposals

Strategic timing matters:

- **Early in election cycle** - Less risky, gives time for voters to forget
- **Mid-cycle** - Normal time for routine proposals
- **Late in cycle** - High-risk, highly visible, defines your campaign
- **After winning election** - Mandate to implement your platform

## Party Settings

### Communication Preferences

Configure how you receive notifications:

- Email alerts for new proposals
- Election reminders
- Message notifications
- Vote deadline warnings

### Privacy Settings

Control visibility of:

- Your party's ideological positions (always visible)
- Commissioned polls (public or private)
- Internal party information

## Multiple Parties

You can create **multiple parties**:

- **In different countries** - Fully allowed, recommended for experienced players
- **In the same country** - Generally not allowed or discouraged (check rules)

Each party is independent with its own:

- Political Power pool
- Seats and voting weight
- Character roster
- Legislative record

## Party Dissolution

Parties can become inactive if:

- The controlling player stops participating
- The party loses all seats and remains inactive
- The player chooses to abandon the party

!!! warning "Inactive Parties"
    Inactive parties may be removed from the game after extended periods of inactivity.
