# Political Power

**Political Power (PP)** is the action resource that enables you to take major actions in Lawmaker. This guide explains how PP works and how to manage it effectively.

## What is Political Power?

Political Power represents your party's:

- Organizational capacity
- Political capital
- Resource mobilization ability
- Action economy

Every major action in the game costs PP, making it a crucial strategic resource.

## How PP Works

### Generation

You gain PP automatically over time:

- **Base rate:** 1 PP per game day (modified by your positions)
- **Real time:** 1 PP per real-world hour
- **Automatic:** No action required
- **Per party:** Each party has its own PP pool

!!! info "Passive Income"
    You don't need to do anything to gain PP - it accumulates automatically as long as your party exists.

### Modifiers

PP generation multiplies based on your party's current power:

- **Head of State:** +20% if you hold the Head of State position (via a single-seat legislature or a cabinet position)
- **Cabinet positions:** +10% for each other cabinet position you hold
- **Legislature seats:** +10% if you hold any seats in a legislature (excluding single-seat legislatures)
- **Legislature majority:** +10% if you hold a majority in a legislature

Modifiers compound multiplicatively (e.g., 1.20 × 1.10 × 1.10).

### Maximum Capacity

Your PP pool has a **maximum capacity**:

- **Cap:** 120 PP
- **No overflow:** PP stops accumulating at 120
- **Use it or lose it:** Can't bank beyond the cap

!!! warning "Don't Waste PP"
    If you're at 120 PP, any additional generation is wasted. Spend PP before hitting the cap!

### Starting Amount

New parties start with:

- **Initial PP:** 100 PP
- **Enough for:** 3 proposals, or a mix of proposals, recruitment, and polls
- **Check dashboard:** See your current PP on your party dashboard

## Resource Management Strategy

### Budget Planning

Think of PP as a budget with two components:

1. **Income (base):** 1 PP/hour × 24 hours = 24 PP/day (before modifiers)
2. **Expenses:** What you spend on actions

**Daily budget (base):** You can sustainably spend ~24 PP per day before modifiers

**Weekly budget (base):** ~168 PP per week before modifiers

!!! example "Weekly Budget Example"
    - Propose 3 laws: 90 PP
    - Recruit 2 characters: 20 PP
    - Commission 2 polls: 20 PP
    - **Total:** 130 PP (sustainable with 168 PP/week income)

### Spending Priorities

#### High Priority (Core Actions)

1. **Proposing important laws** (30 PP)
   - Defines your legislative agenda
   - High visibility
   - Long-term impact

2. **Recruiting key activists** (10 PP)
   - Builds your team
   - Enables cabinet appointments
   - Long-term investment

#### Medium Priority (Strategic Actions)

3. **Commissioning polls** (10 PP)
   - Tracks electoral position
   - Informs strategy
   - Useful but not critical

4. **Calling early elections** (30 PP)
   - Only when you have clear advantage
   - High-risk, high-reward
   - Situational

#### Low Priority (Rare Actions)

5. **Expelling characters** (25 PP)
   - Only when necessary
   - Expensive and permanent
   - Usually avoidable

### Saving vs. Spending

=== "Conservative Approach"
    **Save PP for opportunities**

    ✓ Always have reserves for urgent proposals
    ✓ Can react to changing situations
    ✓ Never resource-starved
    ✗ May miss opportunities
    ✗ Wastes generation if capped at 120

=== "Active Approach"
    **Spend PP regularly**

    ✓ Maximize actions per day
    ✓ Stay active in legislation
    ✓ Build larger activist roster
    ✗ No reserves for emergencies
    ✗ Can't react to surprises

=== "Balanced Approach"
    **Maintain 30-60 PP reserve**

    ✓ Can propose law when needed
    ✓ Use most of generated PP
    ✓ Flexible and responsive

    **Recommended for most players**

## PP Strategy by Game Phase

### Early Game (First Election Cycle)

**Focus:** Build foundation

- **Recruit 2-3 activists** (20-30 PP) - Build your team
- **Propose 1-2 laws** (30-60 PP) - Establish positions
- **Commission 1 poll** (10 PP) - Understand electorate
- **Save rest** - Keep reserves for opportunities

### Mid Game (Established Party)

**Focus:** Active participation

- **Propose laws regularly** - 1-2 per month
- **Maintain activist roster** - Recruit as needed
- **Poll strategically** - Before elections or major proposals
- **Respond to events** - Use PP for tactical moves

### Late Game (Major Party)

**Focus:** Strategic dominance

- **Lead legislative agenda** - Frequent proposals
- **Build deep activist roster** - 5+ characters
- **Commission polls regularly** - Track standings
- **Call early elections** - When advantageous

## Efficiency Tips

### Maximize PP Value

1. **Plan proposals carefully**
   - 30 PP is expensive
   - Don't waste on doomed proposals
   - Build coalition support first

2. **Recruit strategically**
   - Focus on high-trait activists
   - Quality over quantity
   - 3 great activists > 10 mediocre ones

3. **Poll before spending**
   - 10 PP poll can prevent wasting 30 PP on bad proposal
   - Check electoral position before calling early election

4. **Use free actions**
   - Vote on everything (free)
   - Communicate extensively (free)
   - Build coalitions through messaging (free)

### Avoid PP Waste

!!! warning "PP Traps"
    - **Capping out** - Hitting 120 PP wastes generation
    - **Panic spending** - Using PP on low-value actions just to spend it
    - **Failed proposals** - 30 PP spent with no result
    - **Unnecessary expulsions** - 25 PP to remove activists you just recruited
    - **Poorly timed elections** - 30 PP for election you'll lose

## PP in Coalition Play

### Coalition Efficiency

When in coalition:

- **Coordinate proposals** - Take turns proposing to share PP cost
- **Pool resources conceptually** - "You propose this, I'll propose that"
- **Support each other** - Vote for coalition partners' proposals
- **Maximize collective impact** - More proposals passed per PP spent

!!! example "Coalition Coordination"
    **Green-Social Coalition**

    - Green Party proposes environmental law (30 PP)
    - Social Party proposes healthcare law (30 PP)
    - Both vote Yes on each other's proposals
    - **Result:** 60 PP total, 2 laws passed (efficient!)

### Solo Play Challenges

Without coalition:

- **Harder to pass proposals** - Need broader support
- **More PP wasted** - Failed proposals
- **Less efficient** - Can't coordinate with partners

## Emergency PP Management

### Running Low on PP

If you're resource-starved:

1. **Stop spending** - Build reserves
2. **Focus on voting** - Free action, still impacts game
3. **Communicate** - Free coalition building
4. **Wait for regeneration** - Base 24 PP/day adds up (and modifiers can increase it)
5. **Prioritize critical actions** - Only spend on essential proposals

### PP Surplus

If you're capped at 120 PP:

1. **Propose laws** - Use your political capital
2. **Recruit activists** - Build long-term assets
3. **Commission polls** - Gather intelligence
4. **Stay active** - Don't let PP waste

## Advanced PP Tactics

### Timing Regeneration

Since PP regenerates at 1/hour:

- **30-hour wait** = 30 PP (one proposal)
- **10-hour wait** = 10 PP (one recruit/poll)
- **5-day wait** = 120 PP (full tank)

Plan actions around regeneration timing.

### PP Denial (Opponent Strategy)

You can't directly affect rivals' PP, but you can:

- Make them waste PP on failed proposals (vote No)
- Force them to spend PP responding to your proposals
- Time proposals when rivals are low on PP

### Resource Pressure

Use PP to maintain constant activity:

- Regular proposals keep rivals voting
- Active recruitment builds team advantage
- Frequent polls give information edge

## Monitoring PP

### Dashboard Display

Your party dashboard shows:

- **Current PP** - How much you have now
- **Maximum (120)** - Cap display
- **Recent spending** - Transaction history
- **Next actions** - What you can afford

### Planning Ahead

Before spending, consider:

- **Current PP:** Can you afford it?
- **Regeneration time:** How long to replenish?
- **Upcoming needs:** Election, cabinet formation, coalition deals?
- **Alternative actions:** Is there a better use of this PP?

## PP Mistakes to Avoid

!!! danger "Common Errors"
    1. **Wasting 30 PP on doomed proposals** - Build support first!
    2. **Hitting 120 PP cap repeatedly** - Use it or lose it
    3. **Recruiting too many activists** - Quality > quantity
    4. **Expelling characters unnecessarily** - 25 PP is expensive
    5. **Calling early elections without advantage** - 30 PP gamble
    6. **Not saving for opportunities** - Always keep some reserves
    7. **Spending just to spend** - Every PP should have purpose

## Tips for PP Mastery
